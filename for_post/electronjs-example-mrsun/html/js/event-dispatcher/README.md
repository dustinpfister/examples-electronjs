## EventDispacher

I might not use threejs as part of the stack for this project, however I might still want to use a few features from the library to help with making a simple 2d project. One of these features I would like to use is Event Dispatcher which is a great way to create custom user defined Events for plain old javaScript Objects.

There is a stand alone repo for this here:

https://github.com/mrdoob/eventdispatcher.js

however it can also be found in the \/src\/core folder of the three.js repo as well
