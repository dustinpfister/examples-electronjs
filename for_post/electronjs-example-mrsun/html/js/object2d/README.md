# Object2d

I want a basic object2d class that is like the object3d class in threejs. For this game I can use this for creating Objects Like Sprite that I can then used to make the sun object, land section objects, as well as things like buttons and dialogs as well. There is also making a Group2D class that is a way to just Group together a Bunch of Object2d like objects.
