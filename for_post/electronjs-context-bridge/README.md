# electionjs-context-bridge

This is a quick example that I put togetaher while reading up on the context bridge class in electron.js. The example is the start of a very basic text editor program that I am using to write this read me file actually.


## What the goals are with this example


## Getting this working

with the root of this folder as the current working folder just do an npm install, and then an npm start.

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
