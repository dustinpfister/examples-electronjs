# electionjs-app-videoground

This is an idea for an electron.js applaction that I am calling videoground which is a play on the words 'video', and 'playground'. In orther words the main gold with this porject is to just simply have fun with electronjs, threejs, vuejs, mu own vanilla javaScript code and any addtional assets to create an applaction where the content that is to be created is a video project.
