# mrsun-game

The main game module of mrsun includes methods for creating and updating a game state object. At this time I am still making a lot of changes so I will not be writing too much for now.

## Future changes

* I think I will want to pull the Lands class as well as all the other classes from that into its own file
* The constants that I have in here should maybe be a whole other module actualy ( mrsun-constants )
