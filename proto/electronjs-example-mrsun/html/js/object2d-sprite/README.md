## object2d-sprite

I might want to make a number of objects based off of the common object2d class. The aim here is to just have a simple 2d raiser Sprite class that will use canvas elements as sprite sheets. With that said this Sprite class will then need to provide 2 classes one for the Object2d based Sprite class and another to help Create a SpriteSheet for it.
