# electionjs-browser-window

This is another basic getting started type example of electronjs, and is actually the very second electronjs application that I have made thus far following my hello world example.

## What the goals are with this example

On top of what I have all ready got working in my hello world example, in this example I would like to work out the following with the browser window class, as well as the Menu Class.

* Create a child window from the main menu of the main window
* have a custom menu for each type of window, main and child
* have more than one index.html file

* display current rev number
* get started with some front end code for the child and main windows

## Getting this working

with the root of this folder as the current working folder just do an npm install, and then an npm start.

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
