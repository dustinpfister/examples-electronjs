# electionjs-hello-world

At the name suggests yes, this is a hello world example for making an electron.js app. I have to get this one out of the way first, so lets get it over with so we can get to the good stuff. I am following a getting started guide at the electron js website found here: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/v14-x-y/tutorial/quick-start

## Getting this working

with the root of this folder as the current working folder just do an npm install, and then an npm start.

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## creating a project like this from an empty folder

On my old windows 10 system I am using a real old version of nodejs, as such I have run into trouble installing election as I expected. However I was able to get my main.js script running by juts making the later version of 10.x the version of election.js that I will be using for this hello world app.

```
npm install electron@10.4.7 --save-dev
```
