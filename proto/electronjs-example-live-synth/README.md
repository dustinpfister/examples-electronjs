# electionjs-example-live-synth

I have started making videos that have to do with sound synth, but it would be nice to have a project that is centered on live generation of sound. There are two general ideas that I have in mind for this one of which is to have nodejs code in which I generate sample data that will then be piped into the linux aplay command, and the other way is to make use of the web audio API on the front end. Thus far the web audio API approche is proving to be more promising, but I still think both general ideas should be explored.
