# electionjs-example-geometry-position

What I want to at least start here is an application that I can use to create JSON data that follows the format used by the THREE.ObjectLoader class. There is a whole lot that will come up when making this kind of project, but the first and format thing as I see it is to work out ways to create, and mutate the position attribute of a buffer geometry object.
