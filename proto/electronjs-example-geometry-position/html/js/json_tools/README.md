# json_tools

I am going to want to have at least a few methods for dealing with all kinds of things that have to do with JSON. At the time that I started this module I all ready have a custom replacer function that is working okay thus far, but I am sure will need an additional fix now and then to say the least. So there is formating json text for the element that is used to display it, but there are also a few more additional things that I might add to this that have to do with the creation of scene export objects and maybe also starting examples created from code.
