# hello-world

I have to get this one out of the way first, so lets get it over with so we can get to the good stuff. I am following a getting started guide at the electron js website found here: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/v14-x-y/tutorial/installation

On my old windows 10 system I am using a real old version of nodejs, as such I have run into trouble installing election as I expected. However I was able to get my main.js script running by juts making the later version of 10.x the version of election.js that I will be using for this hello world app.

```
npm install electron@10.4.7 --save-dev
```
