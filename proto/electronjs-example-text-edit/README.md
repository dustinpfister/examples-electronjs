# electionjs-app-text-edit

The general idea here is to have a simple text editor based off of what I started with my example on the context bridge class in electron. The focus of the context bridge class was not to make a text editor, but just a simple hello world type application when it comes to getting started with just the context bride class, and various other related features of the context bride class. So then in this example the idea is to just continue forward with the source code of that example, and make something that is a text edit with at least a core set of features that one would expect with a text editor.

## Getting this working

with the root of this folder as the current working folder just do an npm install, and then an npm start.

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
