## () - r0 - very basic idea working
* use ejs for this when it comes to templates
* use marked for parsing markdown files to html
* have a _posts folder in root that will serve as the test built as well as a start folder
* have a build menu
* have a build at option in the build menu
* I will want a themes/default folder that will be the theme to use
