# examples electionjs

I am thinking that I should start a few examples on election.js as this might be another project that I should know at least a thing or two about. I have a few ideas for projects that are desktop applications, and although it might be best to go with some kind of lower level language when it comes to this sort of thing most of my experience programing thus far is with javaScipt.
